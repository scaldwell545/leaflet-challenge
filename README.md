### Level 1: Basic Visualization


1. Data Set

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes-- [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

2. Import & Visualize the Data

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### Level 2: More Data


Pull data on tectonic plates to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. This can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.


* Plot a second data set on our map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to the map.
